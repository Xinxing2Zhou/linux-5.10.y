	  In Extended data out (EDO), a new data cycle is started while the data
	  output of the previous cycle is still active. This process of cycle
	  overlapping, called pipelining, increases processing speed by about
	  10 nanoseconds per cycle,increasing computer performance by about 5
	  percent compared to performance using FMP.
