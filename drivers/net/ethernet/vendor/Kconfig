	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about Vendor devices. If you say Y, you will be asked
	  for your specific card in the following questions.

if NET_VENDOR_VENDOR

endif # NET_VENDOR_VENDOR
